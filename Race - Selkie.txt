/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding Selkie race to the sheet
				Note that you will need to define the race once for every sub-race (i.e. there is a separate entry for High Elf, Wood Elf, and Dark Elf)
				For races that have variants, like the human, you can define a variant using the RaceSubList. Any variant defined like that will only be selectable through the "Racial Options" button
